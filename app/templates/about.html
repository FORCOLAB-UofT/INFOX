                    <p>INFOX comes out of a research project at Carnegie Mellon University, in collaboration with researchers from the IT University Copenhagen, Peking University, and the University of Passau, exploring how to improve collaboration and coordination in open-source and variant-rich software development.</p>
                    <p>Given the overwhelming numbers of forks in many popular repositories, we observed redundant development and lost contributions at scale and heard from interviewed developers
                    that they were interested in activities in forks but overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the task and the lack of adequate tools.
                    INFOX set out to understand activities in forks and provide insights to interested observers of a project and all its forks.
                    The current beta release focuses on simple analytics, but we plan many more functions as we move along.</p>
